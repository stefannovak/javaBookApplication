This is my first independent java project, starting 12/03/19

I want to create my own personal library, where I can:
    Store all of my books into a database
    Allow adding of new books
    Get information of books in my library(title, author, location, genre)
    Allow adding of notes for special books (lost, gift from friend, date received etc)
    Allow deletion of a book
    Show all books(all, certain category, by author etc)

Random thoughts:
    Good opportunity to use SQL?
    Make it a downloadable applet instead for everyone to use?
    Host it on my website?
