# javaBookApplication
My first original Java project

This is my demo project that I will be working on, that hopefully adds to my CV to help secure my first job in software.

I'm using my primary programming language, Java, as I have spent around a year casually learning Java in spare time, and all of March full time studying Java after being made redundant. I doubt anyone is reading this but if you happen upon my app, feel free to send me feedback and ideas! I know it's a real basic vanilla looking app, but maybe this is the start of a full fledged application idea!
