# Java Library Application
My first original Java project

This is a demo project I worked on, to try and solidify my learning of Swing.

I'm using my primary programming language, Java, as I have spent around a year casually learning Java in spare time, and all of March full time studying Java after being made redundant. 

If you are a employer looking at this, just know that I have already learnt so much more than I did when I published this! I have moved onto learning Spring (with some Hibernate too) and am trying to really get a good grasp of that before creating a new projects. Thanks for checking me out!

Feel free to send me feedback and ideas! I know it's a real basic vanilla looking app, but maybe this is the start of a full fledged application idea!
